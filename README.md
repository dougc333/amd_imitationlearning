1) Exploring large data set generation for browser agents. Can we do distillation without large cost burdens on LLM calls? How to measure the efficiency of distillation? Brute force never a good idea. 
2) Exploring Imitation learning strategies to train agents for gpubrowser leaderboard. Behavior cloning and the standard progression to DAgger, GAIL, Inverse RL are ok but there may be more to be gained by using the browser trail. How to model the current or recent rollout history? 
3) Exploring IL strategies for multi task agent applications.
